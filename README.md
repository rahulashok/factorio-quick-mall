# Quick Mall

Quick Mall places a small, configurable ghost build: an assembler plus input/output
logistic chests and inserters. Use the shortcut (or `Ctrl+Q`) to open the menu,
select the item and preferred building/chest/inserter types, then place ghosts
near your character.

## How it works
- The input chest requests 1 full stack of each ingredient.
- The assembler ghost stores the chosen recipe and applies it when built.
- The output chest is placed as the selected provider type.
- Supports quality selection for the target item's ingredients (requires Space Age or a quality mod).

## Controls
- `Ctrl+Q`: Open Quick Mall
- Shortcut bar icon: Open Quick Mall
